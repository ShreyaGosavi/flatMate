**Find your place. Find your people.**

## TL;DR

FlatMate is a web platform for students and young professionals to discover PGs, hostels, and roommates within their community. It combines property listings with community-based roommate boards—solving the fragmented WhatsApp group problem with structure and focus.

## How I Got This Idea

Every semester, college WhatsApp groups flood with messages—"Looking for a roommate", "Any PG available nearby?" Most get buried within hours, lost in message noise.

I watched this cycle repeat endlessly during college. Students need housing and roommates, but the process is scattered and unreliable. No platform connects property discovery with community-based roommate posts.

FlatMate formalizes this fragmented process into a structured platform.

## What is FlatMate?

FlatMate is a web platform focused on PGs, hostels, and shared accommodation for students and working professionals.

Similar to platforms like NoBroker or 99acres, users can:
- List PGs or hostels
- Browse available accommodations
- View detailed property information
- Communicate via chat

However, FlatMate narrows its scope deliberately to shared living and community-driven discovery.

---

## What Makes FlatMate Different?

While existing platforms focus primarily on property listings, FlatMate adds community-based roommate discovery.

In addition to property listings:
- Users can post roommate requirements within a defined community (college or workplace)
- These posts are visible only to relevant users, reducing noise and increasing relevance
- The platform supports direct 1:1 communication to move conversations off scattered messaging apps

FlatMate is intentionally designed for:
- Students
- Early-career professionals
- Shared-living use cases only

It is not a general real estate platform.

## Philosophy

FlatMate is built with a few core principles:

- Solve a specific, real problem rather than many generic ones
- Prefer clarity and correctness over feature volume
- Build systems that are maintainable by design
- Keep the MVP intentionally constrained

Every feature must earn its place in the system.

---

## Vision

FlatMate is not only about solving a housing discovery problem.

This project is also a personal effort to:
- Understand a real-world domain deeply
- Design systems beyond just writing code
- Make architectural decisions with trade-offs
- Learn what it takes to build a product from scratch, end to end

The goal is growth—both of the product and the builder.
